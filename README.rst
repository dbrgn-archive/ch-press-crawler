CH Press Crawler
================

This is an open source / open data project that tries to create a platform which
crawls important Swiss publication sources like newspapers, TV clips, parliament
proceedings and more. It should then provide notifications when certain things
are mentioned.

Here are a few use cases:

- A political party wants to observe the parliament proceedings and get notified
  when one of their core topics is being discussed.
- A club / association wants to collect press coverage.
- A company wants to get notified when legislation is discussed that affects
  their industry.

This project tries to bring more transparency to the Swiss media landscape,
including political discussions.

The project is still at the very beginning, so nothing really works yet. The
following data sources are currently being worked on:

- Curia Vista (database of parliamentary proceedings)
